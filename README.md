# LinkPilot

Decides which browser — and which **profile** of it — every link on this computer opens in, and
takes the tracking out of links on the way. You make named categories like Work, Home or School,
point each at a browser profile, and switch between them with one click.

*LinkPilot was called **Browser Switch** until version 4.0.0.* Installing it with the one command
moves a copy in `Programs\Browser Switch` to `Programs\LinkPilot`, settings and all, and replaces
its shortcuts. A few inside names keep the old one — the program file `BrowserSwitch.exe`, the
registry entries `BrowserSwitchURL` and `BrowserSwitch` — because they are what Windows remembers
as your default browser; renaming them would make you choose it again.

There is also **LinkPilot for Android** — the same idea for a phone, with Quick Settings tiles
and home-screen widgets to switch. It is in the [`android`](android) folder; see its
[README](android/README.md).

## Install

Needs Windows 10 or 11. Two ways — both give you the same program.

### With one command (easiest)

Open **PowerShell** (press the Windows key, type `powershell`, press Enter), paste this and press
Enter:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Husarp/linkpilot/main/get.ps1 | iex
```

That's all. It downloads the **source code** of the latest release, builds the program on your PC
with the C# compiler that is part of Windows — so no ready-made `.exe` is downloaded, and what runs
is exactly the code you can read here — installs it for your account only (no administrator rights),
and opens it. LinkPilot then walks you through the one step Windows leaves to you: choosing it
as your default browser. [Read the script first](get.ps1) if you like — it is short.

- **Update:** run the same command again, or press *Update* in the app. Your settings are kept.
- **Uninstall:** Settings → Apps → Installed apps → LinkPilot → Uninstall. It opens Settings on
  the page of the browser you used before, to make that the default again with one click, then
  removes everything.

### From the files

1. On the [Releases page](https://github.com/Husarp/linkpilot/releases), download
   **`LinkPilot-<version>.zip`** — the ready-made program with everything needed to install and
   remove it. (The release also has `BrowserSwitch.exe` on its own, the Android app, and the source code.)
2. Unzip it into a folder you will keep — Windows runs the program from there.
3. Double-click **`Install.cmd`**. LinkPilot opens and walks you through the rest.

The program is not signed, so Windows may say *"Windows protected your PC"* the first time — *More
info → Run anyway*. More detail under [Setting it up](#setting-it-up).

### What is the difference?

Both end with the same `BrowserSwitch.exe` on your PC. The difference is **where it is made**:

| | One command | From the files |
|---|---|---|
| The program | built **on your PC** from the source code, by the compiler that is part of Windows | built by the author, downloaded ready-made |
| What you trust | the code, which you can read here | that the download matches the code |
| "Windows protected your PC" | no — nothing ready-made was downloaded | may appear once, as for any unsigned program |
| Where it goes | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\LinkPilot`, for your account | any folder you choose |
| Updating | the same command again, or *Update now* in the app | a new zip, or *Update now* in the app |

## Install on Android

Needs Android 8.0 or newer. The app is not in Google Play; it comes from the same release as the
Windows program.

1. On your phone, open the [Releases page](https://github.com/Husarp/linkpilot/releases) and
   download **`LinkPilot-Android-<version>.apk`** (next to `BrowserSwitch.exe`).
2. Open the downloaded file. The first time, Android asks to allow installing apps from the app you
   opened it in (your browser or Files) — allow it, go back and tap **Install**. Google Play Protect
   may warn about an app from an unknown developer — *More details → Install anyway*.
3. Open **LinkPilot**. It walks you through the rest, like on Windows: your choices, then making it
   the default browser (Android's own question — no app can do this without you).

- **Update:** Home › About › **Check for updates on GitHub** opens the Releases page (the app cannot
  go online by itself — it has no internet permission). Download the newer APK and install it over
  the old one; your settings are kept.
- **Uninstall:** as any app — long-press LinkPilot › App info › Uninstall. Android then asks which
  browser should be the default again.

What it does, and what differs from Windows: [LinkPilot for Android](android/README.md).

## What it does

- **Categories** — Work, Home, School… each pointing at a browser and profile; one click switches.
- **The dock** — lives next to the clock, with an icon per category if you like, and a short note
  after every switch.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — one per category, next / previous, and rules on / off.
- **Link rules** — links from chosen apps (Signal → Work) or to chosen sites (github.com → Home) go
  to their own category, whatever is live. A ready-made list of ~175 popular apps to pick from.
- **Link cleaning** — tracking parts (`utm_source`, `fbclid`, YouTube's `si`…) taken out of links, and
  redirects (`google.com/url?q=…`, Outlook Safe Links) skipped, so links go straight to the page.
  If you like, a link you **copy** is cleaned too, so you paste the clean one.
- **Link log** — every link: which app it came from, where it opened, and what was changed.
- **Web page files** (`.htm`, `.html`) show the browser they will open in.
- **Offline and private** — it never sends your links anywhere. It only goes online to check for a
  newer version, and only if you turn that on.

## Privacy and security

**It works offline.** LinkPilot never sends your links, categories, rules or the link log
anywhere, and has no account, ads, tracking or analytics. The one time it connects to the internet
is to ask GitHub whether a newer version exists — only when you press *Check now*, or once a day if
you allow it (off unless you turn it on, in the setup or on the *About & updates* tab) — and, when
you press *Update now*, to download the new version's source code. GitHub then sees only what any
visit to a website shows, such as your internet address. Nothing about your links is sent.

**What it keeps, and where** — all of it in plain text, in its own folder, on your PC only:

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `config.txt` | your categories, rules, shortcuts and settings |
| `link-log.txt` | the link log: the newest 1000 links you opened from other programs (and copied links it cleaned, if that is on) — and so a record of sites you visited. Switch it off, or clear it, on the *Link log* tab |
| `recent-apps.txt` | the programs that opened links lately, for app rules |
| `file-icons\` | the icon web page files show |

**What you copy** is looked at only if you turn on *Clean copied links too* — just to see whether it
is one link on its own — and never kept; what a password manager copies is not looked at at all.

**What it touches in Windows:** only your own account's part of the registry (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER`)
— the registration that makes it a browser Windows can offer, and a Start menu, Desktop and Startup
shortcut. It needs no administrator rights, changes nothing for other accounts, and installs no
service or driver. Uninstalling removes all of it.

**What it cannot do:** make itself your default browser. Windows allows only you to choose that —
no program and no command can — which is also what protects you from programs taking over your
browser. LinkPilot shows you where to click.

**What you can check:** every line of code is here. The one-command install builds the program on
your PC from this code, so nothing ready-made is downloaded. The ready-made `.exe` in the releases is
built from the same code, but it is not signed, so Windows may warn about it the first time.

**Made for personal use** and shared freely under the MIT licence — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Why it is built this way

Windows will not let a script change your default browser. The setting carries a signature tied to
your account, and anything written directly is thrown away. That protection stops programs hijacking
your browser, and it is worth keeping.

So this does not fight it. **LinkPilot becomes the default browser** and passes each link
straight on to the real one, based on which category is live.

Nothing was downloaded to build it. `BrowserSwitch.exe` is compiled from the `.cs` files and
`BrowserSwitch.ico` by the C# compiler already inside Windows (`build.cmd` rebuilds it).

## The dock

LinkPilot lives in the **notification area** next to the clock — "the dock" — and starts there
when you sign in. While its window is open it also has a taskbar button (untick *Show a taskbar
button* on *About & updates* to keep it in the dock only). Closing the window does not stop it — the
first time, a note says so and where to find it.

- **Click its icon** (blue square, two arrows) — the window opens, at once: the dock builds it
  unseen a few seconds after it starts, and closing the window only hides it (it is brought up to
  date each time it opens). The icon stays.
- **Right-click it** — your categories, with a tick on the live one: click one to switch. Also
  *Open LinkPilot* and *Exit*.
- **Pin a category** — in the window, select it and tick **Show in dock**. It gets its own icon; one
  click on that icon switches to it, with no window. **Dock icon…** chooses what it looks like: the
  browser's own icon — for Brave, Chrome and Edge the one **with the profile's picture on it**, the
  same the taskbar shows, which the browser keeps in the profile's folder; that icon **recoloured** — a small editor with *Colour*, *Strength* and
  *Brightness* sliders and a live preview, for two profiles of the same browser (a green Brave for
  Work, an orange one for Home); a colour with the category's first letter; or an image file.
- **Hover over a pinned icon** and it says which category it is: **Work**, or **Switch to Work** —
  choose which in the right-click menu, *Hover text on dock icons*.
- **Every switch shows a short note** at the bottom of the screen for about two seconds —
  "Links now open in: Work", and under it the browser and profile with the category's dock icon
  in front (recoloured, if you recoloured it). It never takes the focus and clicks go straight
  through it. It appears whichever way you switched: an icon, a shortcut, the window, or
  `Back to normal.cmd`.

Windows puts new icons in the hidden-icons area first — the **^** arrow next to the clock. To keep
one always visible, drag it from there onto the taskbar, or switch it on in Settings →
Personalization → Taskbar → *Other system tray icons*.

## Web page files

Saved web pages — `.htm` and `.html` files — show **the browser they will open in**: a white page
with that browser's icon on its corner, the same icon as in the dock (with the profile's picture,
or recoloured, if yours is). It follows every switch, and the rules too, so the icon
always tells the truth about where a double-click goes.

Right-click the dock icon → *Icon of .htm / .html files* to choose the look: **A web page with the
browser's icon**, **The browser's icon** alone, or **LinkPilot's own icon**. Windows usually
redraws at once; if an open folder still shows the old icon, press F5 in it.

## Keyboard shortcuts

**Off until you turn them on:** in the window, the **Shortcuts** tab, then tick **Turn on keyboard
shortcuts**. They then work anywhere, as long as the dock is running.

- **One per category**, and **Next** / **Previous**, which step through every category that has a
  browser, in order, round and round. Every switch shows the usual note — and if the category was
  already live, the note says so, so a key press never goes unanswered.
- **Suggested keys are filled in already.** Ctrl+Alt+1, 2, 3… where free, otherwise the same with
  Shift, otherwise Ctrl+Alt + a letter of the category's name; for next/previous Ctrl+Alt+Space /
  Shift+Space, otherwise PageDown/PageUp — each checked with Windows first, so only free keys are
  suggested. Other programs often hold every Ctrl+Alt+number already; then Work gets
  **Ctrl+Alt+W**, Home **Ctrl+Alt+H**, and so on.
- **To change one:** click its box and press **any key** — alone or with Ctrl, Alt, Shift or Win.
  Special keys work too: media keys (play/pause, volume, next track), **F13–F24**, mail/calculator/
  browser launch keys, Print Screen, Pause. **Clear** empties a line. While you record, Enter, Esc,
  Tab and Backspace are recorded like any other key. While the tab is open the dock lets go of its
  keys, so pressing one records it instead of switching.
- **Active** — the tick in front of each name. Untick it to switch that one shortcut off: its keys
  are kept but do nothing, and other programs can use them again. The big *Turn on keyboard
  shortcuts* tick still switches all of them at once.
- **Reset** appears next to a shortcut once it differs from the one suggested, and puts that back.
- **In next / previous** — a tick per category. Next and Previous only stop at the ticked ones
  (all of them to begin with); a category's own shortcut works either way. If the live category is
  not ticked, they still move on from where it sits in the list.
- **Not every key can be used.** Logitech's **Easy-Switch keys** (1, 2, 3 — they choose which paired
  device the keyboard talks to) are handled inside the keyboard itself and never reach the PC; that
  is also why Logi Options+ cannot reassign them. The top-row keys and the ones at the top right
  usually can be given F13–F24 in Logi Options+.
- **A keyboard button that shows nothing** when pressed is handled by the keyboard's own software
  (for Logitech: Logi Options+). Give it a keystroke there — F13 to F24 are ideal, since no keyboard
  has them and nothing else uses them — then record that.
- **Each line says whether it will work:** *ready*, *taken by another program*, *used twice here*, or
  *types something* — a plain **K** types k, so while it is a shortcut you could not type k anywhere.
  That is allowed; it is your choice. On Polish and many other keyboards **Ctrl+Alt is AltGr** —
  Ctrl+Alt+A types ą — so those are never *suggested*, and are flagged the same way if you pick one.

## Link rules

Some links should always go to the same place, whatever is live: links from Signal to Work, GitHub
links to Home. In the window, the **Rules** tab.

- **Two kinds.** *comes from an app* — the program the link was clicked in; *address has* — a site
  like `github.com`, which also covers the sites under it (`gist.github.com`), or any text with a `/`
  in it (`github.com/my-company`), looked for anywhere in the link.
- **Rules win over the live category.** They are checked from the top, and the first that matches
  decides — **Move up / Move down** set the order. A link no rule matches goes to the live category
  as always. A link sent by a rule shows no note.
- **A tick per rule** keeps it but stops it. A rule whose category has been deleted is skipped.
- **Edit…** (or double-click a rule) changes the profile its links go to — and, for an address
  rule, the address.
- **One rule per app or address.** Adding (or editing into) one that already has a rule asks which
  stays: *Replace the older rule* — the new one takes its place in the order — or *Keep the older
  rule*.
- **The list** shows an app rule under *When a link comes from* and an address rule under *or its
  address has* — one list, so the order counts across both. An app rule shows its app's icon (when
  the program can be found), and *Goes to profile* the browser's icon as that profile shows it.
- **Rules on / off — one switch for all of them**, reachable three ways: the **Use rules** tick at the
  top of the window, *Use rules* in the dock's right-click menu, and its own **keyboard shortcut**
  (on the *Shortcuts* tab, suggested Ctrl+Alt+R, or the nearest free one). Off, every link simply opens in
  the live category — switch category and all links follow. The note says which it is now.
- **Add apps…** opens a ready-made list of about 175 popular apps in groups — chat & social, work &
  office, email, AI assistants, notes & study, gaming, development, music & video, creative, files &
  sync, utilities — with a search box. Tick any number, choose their category, **Add**. **Opened
  links lately** lists the programs that really opened links on this PC, and **Browse for a
  program…** takes any other.
- **How the app is known:** when a program opens a link, Windows starts LinkPilot from inside
  it, so LinkPilot asks Windows who started it. A few apps — mostly from the Microsoft Store —
  hand links over through a Windows go-between; their rules cannot see them, so use an address rule
  for those. *Opened links lately* shows what really opened your links.

## Link cleaning

Many links carry extra parts that only say where the click came from — `utm_source=newsletter`,
`fbclid=…`, YouTube's `si=…` — and some go through a middleman first, so it learns where you went:
`google.com/url?q=<the real link>`, Outlook's Safe Links, Facebook's `l.php`. The **Link cleaning** tab
takes both out before the link is handed on:

- **Skip redirects** — 15 middlemen whose links carry the real one inside (Google search results,
  Gmail and Docs, Google Ads, Outlook and Teams Safe Links, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, YouTube,
  Steam, LinkedIn, DuckDuckGo, VK, Slack, Reddit). The real link opens directly.
- **Remove tracking** — 110 known tracking parts: `utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid` and the other ad
  click IDs, newsletter tracking, and on their own sites YouTube's and Spotify's `si`, and the
  **online shops'** tracking, share and affiliate parts — Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, Allegro, Temu,
  Shein, Etsy, Walmart, Ceneo (mostly from [ClearURLs](https://clearurls.xyz)' rules). The product
  itself stays in the link. Only parts known to be tracking are removed, and everything else in
  the link stays exactly as it was, so links keep working.
- Both are on to begin with; every part and middleman has its own tick, and **Add a part…** adds
  your own. **Try a link** shows what any link becomes.
- **Clean copied links too** (off to begin with) — when you copy a link — YouTube's *Copy link*, a
  link from a chat — the same cleaning is done to it right away, so pasting gives the clean link. A
  short note says so, and it goes in the link log as *(copied)*. Only a copied link on its own is
  changed: text with a link inside, several lines, and anything a password manager copies (they mark
  it private) are left exactly as they are. What you copy is only looked at, never kept or sent.
  Windows' clipboard history (Win+V) still shows the link as it was copied as well — Windows keeps
  it before any program can clean it.

When a link you open had something taken out, a short note says so — *Link cleaned*, and what went
— while the page opens. It happens before the rules look at the link, so a rule for `github.com` also
catches a Google link to GitHub. Two things it cannot do: a link clicked *inside* a browser never reaches LinkPilot —
Google's own result links included — so that needs a browser extension; and short links (`bit.ly`,
`t.co`) are not followed, because only their server knows where they lead and LinkPilot does
not go online.

## Link log

The **Link log** tab (also in the dock's right-click menu) lists every link LinkPilot handed
on: when, which app it came from, where it opened and why ("Work — rule: comes from Signal"), and
whether it was changed. Select one to see it in full — with the link as it came, if it was changed.
**Copy link**, **Open again**, **Clear log**. The list updates by itself as links come in.

The log stays on this computer only, in `link-log.txt` next to the program, and keeps the newest
1000 links. **Keep a log of links** switches it off.

## Updates

On the *About & updates* tab: **Check now** asks GitHub whether a newer version exists; tick **Check
for updates automatically** to have it asked once a day (off to begin with). When one exists, **Update
now** downloads its source code, builds it on your PC and restarts LinkPilot, keeping your
settings — the same as running the install command again. See [Privacy and security](#privacy-and-security)
for what that connection involves.

## The window

Click the dock icon, or **Switch browser** on your Desktop. Each tab has one round **ⓘ** next to its
top heading: click it and a panel explains every part of that tab — each section by name, in short
points; a click on the ⓘ again, or anywhere else, closes it. While LinkPilot is not the default
browser, the window opens on the **setup screen** instead (see [Setting it up](#setting-it-up)).

- **Top** — where links go right now, with the category's icon. While LinkPilot is not the
  default browser it says so instead — links then go straight to the default browser (it names
  which) — and a yellow strip offers to set it up. It checks again whenever the window comes to the
  front.
- **Tabs:**
  - **Categories** — your categories on the left, each with its icon and what it opens in; the
    live one is tagged **LIVE**; below them **Show in dock** and **Dock icon…**. On the right,
    every browser on this computer with its profiles. Nothing is hard-coded: browsers come from
    the Windows registry, Firefox profiles from `profiles.ini`, and Chrome / Edge / Brave /
    Vivaldi profiles from each browser's own `Local State` file, so the names shown are the names
    you gave them. Each profile shows its own picture where the browser keeps one, and which of
    your categories use it (`Work (Profile 2)  ←  Work`).
  - **Rules**, **Shortcuts**, **Link cleaning**, **Link log**, **About & updates** — see their
    sections above.
- **Bottom** — one button per category: click one and links go there from that moment on.

To set a category up: select it on the left, select a profile on the right, press **Use this for …**.

## Files

| | |
|---|---|
| **Switch browser** (Desktop) | opens the window |
| **LinkPilot** (Start menu) | opens the same window |
| **LinkPilot** (Startup folder) | starts the dock when you sign in. Delete it to stop that — nothing else depends on it |
| **Back to normal.cmd** | the panic button — every link goes to your original default browser: no category is live any more, and the rules are switched off too. Nothing is uninstalled and no category or rule is lost |
| `config.txt` | your categories, rules and settings, in plain text. The window writes it; you can edit it by hand |
| `file-icons\` | the icon web page files show right now — drawn after each switch; safe to delete |
| `recent-apps.txt` | the programs that opened links lately — offered when you add app rules |
| `link-log.txt` | the link log — the newest 1000 links; stays on this computer |
| **Install.cmd** | double-click to register LinkPilot with Windows — runs `install.ps1` |
| `install.ps1` | adds LinkPilot to the Windows list of browsers |
| `uninstall.ps1` | removes it completely — after making your previous browser the default again |
| `get.ps1` | the one-command installer and updater (see [Install](#install)) |
| `build.cmd` | rebuilds the program |
| `BrowserSwitch.ico` | the icon — two opposite arrows — built into the exe |
| `LICENSE` | MIT — use, change and share it freely, keeping the copyright notice |

## Setting it up

The one command under [Install](#install) does all of this by itself. By hand:

1. **Get the program**, either way:
   - **Download** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Husarp/linkpilot/releases) —
     `LinkPilot-<version>.zip` — and unzip it
     into a folder you will keep. The program is not signed, so Windows may say *"Windows protected your PC"* the
     first time — *More info → Run anyway*.
   - or **build it**: double-click `build.cmd`. It makes `BrowserSwitch.exe` with the C# compiler
     already inside Windows (.NET Framework 4). Nothing is downloaded.

   Keep the folder where it is afterwards: Windows is told to run the program from there.
2. **Double-click `Install.cmd`** from File Explorer. It runs `install.ps1`, which registers Browser
   Switch and opens it. Run it yourself: registry changes made from inside some programs — AI
   coding assistants included — land in a private copy of the registry that only that program sees,
   and Windows Settings would never see LinkPilot.

LinkPilot is **not** your default browser yet after that — Windows requires you to choose it
yourself. So LinkPilot opens on a **setup screen** — on its first start, and again whenever it
is not the default browser — in three steps (Back and Skip on the left, the blue button on the right):

1. **How it works** — why it has to be the default browser (every link must pass through it, and
   Windows sends links only to the default browser), and why it can be trusted: fully offline,
   sends nothing, made for personal use, open, easy to undo.
2. **Your choices** — clean links (on), clean copied links too (off), keep a log of links (on),
   check for updates automatically (off). All can be changed later on their tabs.
3. **Make it your default browser** — *Open Windows Settings* opens on LinkPilot's own page;
   press *Set default*; the setup screen notices by itself. If LinkPilot already is the
   default, this step just says so.

Then a big **You're all set!** — and if you have no category yet, the browser you used until now
becomes the first one, live (for example **Firefox**), so links keep going exactly where they went.
*Finish* opens the main window. No program or command can
   make this choice for you — Windows ignores them, which is what keeps programs from taking over
   your browser.

By hand, in Settings → Apps → Default apps there are two ways:

- **By app** — under *Set defaults for applications*, find **LinkPilot** (blue square, two
  arrows), open it, press **Set default**.
- **By link type** — in the top box, *Set a default for a file type or link type*, type `HTTP`, click
  the app shown under it, and choose **LinkPilot**. Then the same for `HTTPS`.

Until you do, nothing changes. If you skip the setup screen, the window says so across the top in
yellow, and its *Set it up* button brings the setup screen back.

**If LinkPilot is not offered:** double-click `Install.cmd` again — yourself, not from inside
another program — then close Settings completely (clicking the X only hides it) and open it again.
What `install.ps1` sets up, and why:

- **the registration** — a link handler, `BrowserSwitchURL`, and an entry in `RegisteredApplications`
  saying it handles http, https, .htm and .html. This is what puts it in Windows' list of apps for
  links;
- **an identity** — a name, an icon and a publisher, both inside the exe and on the link handler, and
  one app ID, `com.husarp.linkpilot` (the same as the Android app's), shared by the link handler and
  the Start menu shortcut. Before 2.2.0 the exe had no icon and a blank name, so the most Windows could call it was
  "BrowserSwitch.exe";
- **a Start menu shortcut**, and an entry in Settings → Apps → Installed apps, so it can be found and
  removed like any other program.

## If something goes wrong

A link must never die because the switcher is confused. Where a link goes is worked out in one place,
and `--dry` reports exactly what a real click would do, so the two can never disagree:

0. first the link is cleaned — redirects skipped, tracking removed — if link cleaning is on;
1. *(while rules are on)* the first ticked rule that matches, if its category's browser
   still exists;
2. the live category, if its browser still exists;
3. otherwise the browser that was your default **before** LinkPilot was installed — recorded at
   install time, so a machine with nothing set up behaves exactly as it did before (installed again
   or moved while LinkPilot already is the default, it is taken over from the copy installed
   before);
4. otherwise the first browser Windows lists.

Anything unexpected is written to `errors.log`. Tested against: no config at all, a config with no
categories, a live category with no browser chosen, and a category pointing at a browser that has
been deleted — all four fall through correctly.

Two levels of undo, on purpose:

- **Pause** — `Back to normal.cmd`. Instant, nothing removed; pick a category and tick *Use rules*
  to switch back on.
- **Remove** — Settings → Apps → Installed apps → LinkPilot, or run `uninstall.ps1`. While
  LinkPilot is the default browser, it first opens Settings on the page of the browser you used
  before — one click on *Set default* (Windows lets no program do that click) — waits for it, and
  then removes everything, so Windows is never left pointing at something that no longer exists.
  Every registry key it created lives under your own user account and is deleted.

## Command line

```
BrowserSwitch.exe <url>          open a link in the live category
BrowserSwitch.exe                open the window (starting the dock if it is not running)
BrowserSwitch.exe --tray         start the dock only - what runs when you sign in
BrowserSwitch.exe --switch Work  make a category live, no window
BrowserSwitch.exe --reset        every link to the original default browser - and rules off
BrowserSwitch.exe --dry <url>    write where the link WOULD go, and what cleaning changes, to dry-run.log; open nothing
   --dry <url> --from Signal.exe   ...as if the link had been clicked in Signal (tries app rules)
BrowserSwitch.exe --list         write the browsers and profiles it can see to detected.txt
BrowserSwitch.exe --selftest     build the window in memory and report what it holds, without showing it
```

## One caveat, with Firefox

Firefox is launched with `-P "profile name"`. If Firefox is already running with a different profile,
it may open the link in the window that is already there rather than starting the profile you asked
for. Chrome, Edge and Brave handle `--profile-directory` cleanly whether or not they are running.
