# LinkPilot - install or update with one command, in PowerShell:
#
#     irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Husarp/linkpilot/main/get.ps1 | iex
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. asks GitHub which release is the newest, and downloads that release's source code;
#   2. builds BrowserSwitch.exe from it with the C# compiler that is part of Windows - no ready-made
#      .exe is downloaded, so what runs is exactly the code you can read on GitHub;
#   3. puts it in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\LinkPilot - for your account only, no admin rights;
#   4. registers it with Windows (install.ps1) and starts it. The first time, it opens on the setup
#      screen, which walks you through the one step Windows leaves to you.
#
# Run it again to update: your categories, rules and settings are kept. The app itself updates with
# LinkPilotSetup.exe instead. To remove LinkPilot: Settings > Apps > Installed apps.
#
# Environment variables that change where things come from and go:
#   BROWSERSWITCH_DIR         install here instead
#   BROWSERSWITCH_UPDATE      "1": this is an update - start in the background afterwards, no window
#   BROWSERSWITCH_SOURCE      testing: a .zip of the source on this PC, instead of the newest release
#   BROWSERSWITCH_NOREGISTER  testing: "1" builds and copies only - stops, registers and starts nothing
